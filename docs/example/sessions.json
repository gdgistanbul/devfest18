Since then I am working on building robots of purpose. I  am learning to code in Python, Javascript, and Ruby. Upto today I have completed 3 robotic projects in all of them I used Arduino and wrote codes in Arduino IDE and two of the projects include mobile application for Android which is made in App Inventor 2. Now I am working on upgrading my award winning Robot Project iC4U. In this version I am using Raspberry Pi and Google's AIY - Project Bonnets (voice and vision) which will add direct voice command and image processing capabilities to my robot.   "
